{"name":"Mandrill Alternative That Leverages Mailgun & Sendgrid","tagline":"Don't just rely on 1 email API!","body":"# Welcome to a Mandrill alternative\r\nWith the recent announcement about Mandrill, we wanted to provide a way to leverage other email API's. This is a simple program that allows you to easily send emails using both Mailgun and SendGrid. You can choose to use both API's by rotating email sending between the two or you can simply choose to use one or the other. The benefit is you are not locked into only 1 provider and can leverage both if wanted. We may add additional email API services in the future.\r\n\r\n### Email Templates\r\nAdd email templates to a table, set a schedule date, from name, from email and more. Supports both HTML & plain text emails.\r\n\r\n### Open & Link Click Tracking\r\nEmail open tracking and link tracking are built right in. Opens and link click data is saved in a table.\r\n\r\n### Starter tables provided\r\nAn sql file is provided with the tables that are used in this example. Import the sql file into a new database to get started quickly. Or modify the code to fit your existing tables. All code that inserts/updates database tables is located in the applications directory. Database connection uses PDO.\r\n\r\n### Modify Config.php file\r\nModify the applications/Config.php with your settings.\r\nNOTE: You need to have composer installed on your server. We included the needed composer.json and lock files along with all packages needed within the vendor directory. You should be able to upload everything as is to your domain or a sub directory on your domain and it should work as long as composer is installed.\r\n\r\n# [**Hire us for customizations**](http://www.gosmartsolutions.com/#contact)\r\nWould you like help installing this on your server or do you need help with customizations?
