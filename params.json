Supports both HTML & plain text emails. We even give you a responsive email template to start with.\r\n\r\n### Open & Link Click Tracking\r\nEmail open tracking and link tracking are built right in. Opens and link click data is saved in a database.\r\n\r\n### Starter MySQL tables provided\r\nAn sql file is provided with the tables that are used in this program. Import the sql file into a new MySQL database to get started quickly. Or modify the code to fit your existing tables.
