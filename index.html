<p>This is a simple program that allows you to easily send email newsletters using both Mailgun and SendGrid. You can choose to use both by switching email sending between the two or you can simply choose to use one or the other.</p>

<h3>
<a id="email-templates" class="anchor" href="#email-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Email Templates</h3>

<p>Add your email newsletter templates to a MySQL table, set a schedule date, from name, from email and more. Supports both HTML &amp; plain text emails. We even give you a responsive email template to start with.</p>

<h3>
<a id="open--link-click-tracking" class="anchor" href="#open--link-click-tracking" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open &amp; Link Click Tracking</h3>

<p>Email open tracking and link tracking are built right in. Opens and link click data is saved in a database.</p>

<h3>
<a id="starter-mysql-tables-provided" class="anchor" href="#starter-mysql-tables-provided" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Starter MySQL tables provided</h3>

<p>An sql file is provided with the tables that are used in this program. Import the sql file into a new MySQL database to get started quickly. Or modify the code to fit your existing tables. All code that inserts/updates database tables is located in the applications directory. Database connection uses PDO.</p>

<a id="modify-1-configphp-file" class="anchor" href="#modify-1-configphp-file" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modify 1 Config.php file</h3>

<p>Modify the applications/Config.php with your settings.
NOTE: You need to have composer installed on your server. We included the needed composer.json and lock files along with all packages needed within the vendor directory. You should be able to upload everything as is to your domain or a sub directory on your domain and it should work as long as composer is installed.</p>
